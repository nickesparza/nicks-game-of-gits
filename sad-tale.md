House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

The White Walkers still attacked, but through a cunning alliance with Mothra,
the humans of Westeros successfully repelled the undead advance.
